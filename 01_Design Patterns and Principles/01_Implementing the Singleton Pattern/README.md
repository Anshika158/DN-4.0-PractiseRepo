# ðŸ§¾ Singleton Pattern - Logger 

## ðŸ“Œ What is the Singleton Pattern?

The **Singleton Pattern** is a design pattern used in object-oriented programming. It ensures that a **class has only one object (instance)** throughout the entire lifetime of the application, and provides a **global access point** to that object.

This is useful when you need exactly one resource â€” like a Logger, Configuration Manager, or Database Connection â€” thatâ€™s shared by the entire application.

## ðŸ§  What is an Instance?

- A **class** is like a blueprint.
- An **instance** is a real object created from that class.
